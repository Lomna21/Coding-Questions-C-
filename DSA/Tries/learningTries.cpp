// The Trie data structure is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings. It is commonly used for efficient retrieval and storage of keys in a large dataset. The structure supports operations such as insertion, search, and deletion of keys, making it a valuable tool in fields like computer science and information retrieval. In this article we are going to explore insertion and search operation in Trie Data Structure.
