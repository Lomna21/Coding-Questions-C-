// Longest Subarray with sum K | [Postives and Negatives]
// Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

// Example: 
// N = 3, k = 1, array[] = {-1, 1, 1}
// Result: 3
// Explanation: The longest subarray with sum 1 is {-1, 1, 1}. And its length is 3.

// --------------Naive Approach (Brute-force approach)----------------------

// First, we will run a loop(say i) that will select every possible starting index of the subarray. The possible starting indices can vary from index 0 to index n-1(n = size of the array).
// Inside the loop, we will run another loop(say j) that will signify the ending index of the subarray. For every subarray starting from index i, the possible ending index can vary from index i to n-1(n = size of the array).
// After that for each subarray starting from index i and ending at index j (i.e. arr[iâ€¦.j]), we will run another loop to calculate the sum of all the elements(of that particular subarray).
// If the sum equals k, we will consider its length i.e. (j-i+1). Among all such subarrays, we will consider the maximum length by comparing all the lengths.

// Note: We are selecting every possible subarray using two nested loops and for each of them, we add all its elements using another loop.

// Time Complexity: O(N^3) approx., where N = size of the array.
// Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.


// ------------Better Approach (Using two loops)-----------------------

// First, we will run a loop(say i) that will select every possible starting index of the subarray. The possible starting indices can vary from index 0 to index n-1(n = array size).
// Inside the loop, we will run another loop(say j) that will signify the ending index as well as the current element of the subarray. For every subarray starting from the index i, the possible ending index can vary from index i to n-1(n = size of the array).
// Inside loop j, we will add the current element to the sum of the previous subarray i.e. sum = sum + arr[j]. 
// If the sum is equal to k, we will consider its length i.e. (j-i+1). Among all such subarrays with sum k, we will consider the one with the maximum length by comparing all the lengths.

// Time Complexity : O(N^2) 
// Space Complexity : O(1)


// -----------------Optimal Approach (Using Hashing)--------------------
// For a subarray ending at index i with the prefix sum x, if we remove the part with the prefix sum x-k, we will be left with the part whose sum is equal to k. And that is what we want.
// Instead of searching the subarrays with sum k, we will keep track of the prefix sum of the subarrays generated at every index using a map data structure. 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int getLongestSubarray(vector<int>& a, int k) {
    int n = a.size(); // size of the array.

    map<int, int> preSumMap;
    int sum = 0;
    int maxLen = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //calculate the prefix sum till index i:
        sum += a[i];

        // if the sum = k, update the maxLen:
        if (sum == k) {
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i + 1);
        }

        // calculate the sum of remaining part i.e. x-k:
        int rem = sum - k;

        //Calculate the length and update maxLen:
        if (preSumMap.find(rem) != preSumMap.end()) {
            int len = i - preSumMap[rem];
            maxLen = max(maxLen, len);
        }

        //Finally, update the map checking the conditions: If we minimize the term preSumMap[rem] (i.e. the index where the subarray with sum x-k ends), we will get the maximum length. That is why we will consider only the first or the leftmost index where the subarray with sum x-k ends. After that, we will not update that particular index even if we get a similar subarray ending at a later index.
        if (preSumMap.find(sum) == preSumMap.end()) {
            preSumMap[sum] = i;
        }
    }

    return maxLen;
}

int main()
{
    vector<int> a = { -1, 1, 1};
    int k = 1;
    int len = getLongestSubarray(a, k);
    cout << "The length of the longest subarray is: " << len << "\n";
    return 0;
}

// Time Complexity: O(N) or O(N*logN) depending on which map data structure we are using, where N = size of the array.
// Reason: For example, if we are using an unordered_map data structure in C++ the time complexity will be O(N)(though in the worst case, unordered_map takes O(N) to find an element and the time complexity becomes O(N^          2)) but if we are using a map data structure, the time complexity will be O(N*logN). The least complexity will be O(N) as we are using a loop to traverse the array.
